# Configure LAMP server

## Question

xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host a WordPress website on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. They have already done infrastructure configurationâ€”for example, on the storage server they already have a shared directory /vaw/www/html that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install httpd, php and its dependencies on all app hosts.

b. Apache should serve on port 6000 within the apps.

c. Install/Configure MariaDB server on DB Server.

d. Create a database named kodekloud_db5 and create a database user named kodekloud_joy identified as password Rc5C9EyvbU. Further make sure this newly created user is able to perform all operation on the database you created.

e. Finally you should be able to access the website on LBR link, by clicking on the App button on the top bar. You should see a message like App is able to connect to the database using user kodekloud_joy

## Answer
### Using ansible

Create hosts_inventory file
```bash
vi hosts_inventory.ini
    [app_servers]
    stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n ansible_become_pass=Ir0nM@n
    stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@ ansible_become_pass=Am3ric@
    stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n ansible_become_pass=BigGr33n

    [db_server]
    stdb01 ansible_host=172.16.239.10 ansible_user=peter ansible_ssh_pass=Sp!dy ansible_become_pass=Sp!dy
    
    :wq
